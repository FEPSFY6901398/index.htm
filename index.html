  <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <pre id="Abstract">
Low Earth Orbit Satellites are growing at an exceptional rate (Statista, 2024), with the private sector now more invested in satellite technology 
than the relevant Government Departments (Sweeting, 2018). Combined with little to no international regulation (NASA, 2023); major collisions and
accidents could occur before 2050, causing millions of pounds in damage (Erwin, 2024). Unless strong and decisive action is taken on an international
scale within the next decade, our satellite technologie could be falling out of the sky.

 <pre id="Introduction">
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites are defined by Britannicia as “usually considered to be between 160 and 1,600 km” leading
to Orbit times of “90 minutes to 2 hours” (Ken Stewart et al, 2023). According to the European Space Agency’s 2024 Space Environment Report “2/3rds
of all active satellites are between 500 to 600 km” (ESA, 2024), making it clear that most satellites fall into the category of LEO but why is this?
    </pre>
</p>

    <body style="background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-left:25px;">
      
 <pre id="Analysis and Discussion">
  <h3>Analysis and Discussion</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
One of the main reasons for this growth is the development of what Sweeting (2018) calls “the Small Satellite” (Sweeting, 2018). The reasons for 
the small satellites popularity comes from the fact small satellites allow “the adoption of up-to-date consumer technologie”(Sweeting, 2018), 
this is because small satellites have “rapid development cycles executed by small teams”(Sweeting, 2018). This then led the small satellite to
become commercially viable in the year 2000 as they were able to combine technologie, utility and cost (Sweeting, 2018). This now financially 
viable cost resulted in the private sector taking a greater interest in Satellite development, with innovation and new ideas being developed by 
businesses in the private sector rather than the military and Governments (Sweeting, 2018). A good example of this would be Starlink created and
launched by SpaceX in 2019 (O’Callaghan, 2019), which recently had 20 satellites join the consolation on the 24th of September (SpaceX, 2024).
When referring to 2 sources we know there could be between 6402 (Rannard, 2024) and 6416 (Starlink Satellite Tracker, 2020). The reason for such a 
high number of satellites is because to get the most out of LEO satellites they are used in constellations (Sweeting, 2018).

Constellations are defined by the International Astronomical Union (2020) as a group of satellites that have the same role, function, and are
designed to work as a cohesive group to complete a common task; they can also all be controlled together. Sweeting (2018) says the reasons that
companies now prefer to launch constellations of LEO satellites over larger satellites is because it’s cheaper and easier to produce and launch 
them. There is also a reduced risk when using small satellites as newer technology can be implemented into their design due to the reduced 
manufacturing time (Kogut, 2024).

The reduced size of these small satellites is also an important feature as space isn’t as empty as we are led to believe, according to a the 2023 
Space debris report put  out by the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), there are “34,260 tracked
objects in orbit” with there being “8300 operational Satellites in orbit”.  It’s important to mention that a tracked object is greater in length 
than 10cm (ESA, 2024). The ESA report uses statistical models to predict the number of these objects in orbit, claiming there are “130 million 
objects sized from 1mm-1cm”. At first glance the size of this debris might seem insignificant, however these objects are “traveling over 25,000 kph” 
(UNU-EHS, 2023). So, even though these objects are small they can cause “significant damage” to satellites (UNU-EHS, 2023). By using smaller
satellites they are less likely to come into contact with debris. If an LEO is struck and is put out of commission the loss to the company is less
due to the shorter and (relatively) cheaper manufacturing process (Sweeting, 2018)( Kogut, 2024).
 
The increasing number of Satellites and debris is of concern for NASA as it’s making space missions more difficult, since there is an increasing 
risk to both people and property (NASA, 2023). To combat this, both NASA (2008) and the ESA (2022)  have programs to limit the amount of space 
debris they produce. However this isn’t the international standard; as best put by NASA “Space junk is no one countries' responsibility, but the 
responsibility of every spacefaring country” (NASA, 2023). As LEO satellites grow in popularity; if there is not an international effort made by 
every country there could be major issues ahead. This is really a concern as from 2015-2020 space debris increased by 50% (ESA, 2020), and in that
time there was only an increase of 1858 active satellites (Statista, 2024).

There are estimates of how many LEO satellites Earth’s orbit can hold. The MITRE corporation released a paper in 2021; which contained there
calculations before there is a “significant risk of collision”. Satellites at a height of 600 km, the maximum is 40,000 Satellites. At 1,200 km
it’s 1000 satellitesm (MITRE, 2021). According to the ESA (2024) there are “13,230 satellites in space”, as of current we’re still far from the
40,000 limit but as LEO Satellites get more popular this problem will grow. 

Graphing the Statista 2024 data on the number of active satellites we can gain an equation for the growth of the satellites. The trend line with
the highest R2 value was the exponential trend line with a value of 0.7995, which according to Fernando (2024) is a reasonably good correlation.
The equation gained from the trendline is y=(3*10^(-71))*(e*0.0845x). According to a 2023 Statista report, 88% of satellites in 2022 were LEO 
satellites. So, if we continue launching satellites at the current rate; we can estimate we will reach the 40,000 LEO satellite limit around 2048.

          <pre id="Conclusion">
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
       <p class="ex1">
As even though satellites are cheaper and quicker to produce due to the creation of Cube and small satellites (Sweeting, 2018)(Kogut,2024) it is
clear through the coming years that there needs to be an increase in regulation and greater communication between countries to ensure that safety 
is a number 1 factor for satellites in orbit (NASA, 2023). Hopefully preventing any major satellite incidents, as well as reducing the increasing
number of satellites launching each year (Statista, 2024). This would then ideally stop us from getting closer to the limit of 40,000 (MITRE,2021).
