Low Earth Orbit Satellites are growing at an exceptional rate (Statista, 2024), with the private sector now more invested in satellite technologie than the relevant Government Departments (Sweeting, 2018).
Combined with little to no international regulation (NASA, 2023); major collisions and accidents could occur before 2050, causing millions of pounds in damage (Erwin, 2024). Unless strong and decisive action
is taken on an international scale within the next decade, our satellite technologie could be falling out of the sky.

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites are defined by Britannicia as “usually considered to be between 160 and 1,600 km” (Ken Stewart, et al, 2023) leading to Orbit times of “90 minutes to 2 hours” (Ken Stewart et al, 2023).
According to the European Space Agency’s 2024 Space Environment Report “2/3rds of all active satellites are between 500 to 600 km” (ESA, 2024), making it clear that most satellites fall into the category of LEO but why
is this?

      Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites are defined by Britannicia as “usually considered to be between 160 and 1,600 km” (Ken Stewart, et al, 2023) leading to Orbit times of “90 minutes to 2 hours” (Ken Stewart et al, 2023).  
According to the European Space Agency’s 2024 Space Environment Report “2/3rds of all active satellites are between 500 to 600 km” (ESA, 2024), making it clear that most satellites fall into the category of LEO but why 
is this?

One of the main reasons for this growth is the development of what Professor Sir Martin Sweeting calls “the Small Satellite” (Sweeting, 2018). He claims the reasons for the small satellites popularity comes from the fact 
small satellites allow “the adoption of up-to-date consumer technologie”(Sweeting, 2018), this is because small satellites have “rapid development cycles executed by small teams”(Sweeting, 2018). This then led the small 
satellite to become commercially viable in the year 2000 as they were able to successfully combine technologie, utility and cost (Sweeting, 2018). This now financially viable cost resulted in the private sector taking a 
greater interest in Satellite development, with innovation and new ideas being developed by businesses in the private sector rather than the military and Government agencies (Sweeting, 2018). A good example of this would 
be Starlink created and launched by SpaceX in 2019 (Forbes, 2019), which recently had another 20 satellites join the consolation on the 24th of September (SpaceX, 2024). When referring to 2 sources we know there could be 
between 6402 (BBC,2024) and 6416 (Starlink Satellite Tracker, 2020). The reason for such a high number of satellites is because to get the most out of LEO satellites they are used in constellations (Sweeting, 2018).

Constellations are defined by the International Astronomical Union (2020) as a group of satellites that have the same role, function, and are designed to work as a cohesive group to complete a common task; they can also
all be controlled together. Sweeting (2018) says the reasons that companies now prefer to launch constellations of LEO satellites over larger satellites is because it’s cheaper and easier to produce and launch them. There 
is aso a reduced risk when using small satellites as newer technology can be implemented into their design due to the reduced manufacturing time (Kogut, 2024).

The reduced size of these small satellites is also an important feature as space isn’t as empty as we are led to believe, according to a the 2023 Space debris report put out by the United Nations University Institute for
Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), there are “34,260 tracked objects in orbit” with there being “8300 operational Satellites in orbit”.  It’s important to mention that a tracked object is anything greater in length
than 10cm (ESA, 2024). The ESA report uses statistical models to predict the number of these objects in orbit, with them claiming there are already “130 million objects sized from 1mm-1cm”. At first glance the size of
this debris might seem insignificant, however these objects are “traveling over 25,000 kph” (UNU-EHS, 2023). So even though these objects are small they can cause “significant damage” to these satellites(UNU-EHS, 2023). 
Hence by using these smaller satellites they are less likely to come into contact with the debris, and if an LEO is struck and is put out of commission the loss to the company is less due to the shorter and (relatively) 
cheaper manufacturing process (Sweeting, 2018)(Peter Kogut, 2024).
 
The increasing number of Satellites and debris is also of concern for NASA as it’s making space missions more difficult (NASA, 2023), with the increasing amount of debris and the speed it travels at; there is an increasing
risk to both people and property(NASA, 2023). To combat this, both NASA (NASA, 2008)  and the ESA (ESA,2022)  have programs to try and limit the amount of space debris they produce. However this isn’t the international 
standard yet; as best put by NASA “Space junk is no one countries' responsibility, but the responsibility of every spacefaring country” (NASA, 2023). So as LEO satellites grow in popularity; if there isn’t an international
effort met by every country there could be major issues ahead. This is really a great concern as from 2015-2020 space debris increased by 50% (ESA, 2020), and in that time there was only an increase of 1858 active 
satellites (Statista, 2024).

There are estimates of how many LEO satellites Earth’s orbit can hold. The MITRE corporation released a paper in 2021; which contained there calculations before there is a “significant risk of collision”. For satellites 
at a height of 600 km, the maximum is 40,000. Then at 1,200km it’s 1000 satellites (MITRE, 2021). As of the most current ESA data (2024) there are roughly  “13,230 satellites in space”, as of current we’re still far from
the 40,000 limit but as these LEO Satellites get more popular this problem will grow. 

Graphing the Statista 2024 data on the number of active satellites we can gain an equation for the growth of the satellites. The trend line with the highest R2 value was the exponential trend line with a value of 0.7995,
which according to Investopedia (2024) is a reasonably good correlation. The equation gained from the trendline is y=(3*10-71)*(e0.0845x). According to a 2024 Statista report, 88% of satellites in 2022 were LEO 
satellites. So, if we continue launching satellites at the current rate; we can estimate we will reach the 40,000 LEO satellite limit around 2048.

As even though satellites are cheaper and quicker to produce due to the creation of Cube and small satellites (Sweeting, 2018)(Kogut,2024) it is clear through the coming years that there needs to be an increase in
regulation and greater communication between countries to ensure that safety is a number 1 factor for satellites in orbit (NASA, 2023). Hopefully preventing any major satellite incidents, as well as reducing the 
increasing number of satellites launching each year (Statista, 2024). This would then ideally stop us from getting closer to the limit of 40,000 (MITRE,2021).
